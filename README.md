# Algorithms


#### Running Tests
Tests are written using Unittest.  To run all tests use the following command: 

* `make test`

### Dependencies

This repository currently depends on  `pytest` for running tests.  

Note: To run tests without `make`, it's possibly to just run `pytest` from the commandline. 

```
~/projects/Algorithms(master âœ—) pytest
```
